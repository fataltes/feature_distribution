# Multi-Level Feature Distribution Detection

In this project I am trying to find out the best distribution that describes most of linguistic features in social media in different levels of analysis such as county, user, and message level.
For that, I go through two different regimes
1. Unsupervised
2. Supervised

In "unsupervised" section, we use statistical testing methods to find the mostly confident distribution that best describes our feature empirical distribution.
In "supervised" section, we use a different distributions as a prior in a NaiveBayes classifier to predict a label like gender or sentiment and we see that which of these distributions give us the best accuracy.
